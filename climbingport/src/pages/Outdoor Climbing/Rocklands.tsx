          For years I've dreamed about going to this iconic bouldering destination, but the opportunity never arose due to either money, prior commitments, or simply no crew is psyched to go. The past Summer, I got a message from a friend I met on my gap year when I lived in a minivan that a crew in SLC, UT were psyched to go. All those years of yearning were now a real possibility and I hopped on this opportunity as I didnâ€™t know when schedules would line up like that again!

         On our way to Clanwilliam, three hours north of Cape Town, the trip did not start without a hitch. Five big guys packed in a tiny corolla (to save money!) with all of our gear and crashpads was too much and one of our tires popped. With a 
         doughnut spare, we limped our way to a town fourty-five minutes away to get a new tire. After an exhausting journey, we made it to our housing: a small rudimentary hut that hosted a variety of puddles inside. It was our home for the next 
         eight weeks.

          After some bouts of rain, it was time to climb. Even with all the videos I've watched, my expectations were surpassed with the vast amounts
          of rock just everywhere! I didn't have a strong desire to project a singular climb, but sample all the climbs Rocklands could offer - and there was a lot. 
          <br />
          Even though I wasn't in peak climbing shape, I tried a multitude of hard climbs: including historic climbs Fred Nicole put up in 2002 (I was just born!).
